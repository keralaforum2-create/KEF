I want you to add a full ticket-generation and QR-code system to my existing project.

Below is exactly what I need:

1. After a user submits the registration form successfully, instead of redirecting, show a popup modal that displays a ticket.

2. The ticket design must match this image I uploaded (Kerala Startup Fest ticket).  
   - Keep the layout same.  
   - Only replace the QR code and ticket number dynamically.  
   - Keep logos and colors exactly as they appear in the image.

3. The QR code must be generated uniquely for each user at the moment of registration.  
   - The QR code should encode a unique URL like:
     /checkin/{uniqueID}
   - When scanned, this URL should show the user’s registration details to the event staff.

4. The registration details shown on staff check-in page must include:
   - Full name  
   - Email  
   - Phone number  
   - Organization / College (if present)  
   - Whether they are participating in Pitch Room  
   - If participating in Pitch Room, show only:
        * name  
        * email  
        * phone number  
        * payment proof file or link  

5. Add three buttons under the ticket popup:
   - **Download Ticket** (download the ticket as a PNG or PDF)
   - **View Ticket** (opens the ticket in a new tab)
   - **Done** (closes the popup)

6. Save each user's generated uniqueID + registration data on the server (JSON file or lightweight database). When staff scans the QR code, the system must fetch the data and display it cleanly.

7. The backend should automatically create this ticket image using:
   - The base ticket design I provided  
   - The generated QR code  
   - The user’s name  
   - The ticket number (incremental or random 8-digit number)

8. No email sending needed. Do NOT use email functionality anywhere.

Please update my frontend and backend code to support:
- QR code generation
- Ticket image composition
- Popup modal after registration
- Download/View button functionality
- Staff check-in page at route /checkin/:id

Make sure everything works inside Replit.
